# Portfolio

I began my career in web development building frontends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as social media marketing and design. The growing capabilities of what users could do on the web always fascinated me. This is why I now seek to leverage the ever-expanding JavaScript ecosystem to build full-scale applications on the web with tools such as: React, Express, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS.

When I'm not writing code, I love to explore the world of home espresso. I am also honored to be surrounded by a wonderful wife of 5 years, two boys, and a group of fellow developers who help each other grow daily.
